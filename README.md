## Project Motivation
Airbnb is a home-sharing platform that allows homeowners and renters (‘hosts’) to put their properties (‘listings’) online, so that guests can pay to stay in them. Hosts are expected to set their own prices for their listings. Although Airbnb and other sites provide some general guidance, there are currently no free and accurate services which help hosts price their properties using a wide range of data points.
Paid third party pricing software is available, but generally you are required to put in your own expected average nightly price (‘base price’), and the algorithm will vary the daily price around that base price on each day depending on day of the week, seasonality, how far away the date is, and other factors.
Airbnb pricing is important to get right, particularly in big cities like Boston, New York, Seattle where there is lots of competition and even small differences in prices can make a big difference. It is also a difficult thing to do correctly — price too high and no one will book. Price too low and you’ll be missing out on a lot of potential income.
This project aims to solve this problem, by using machine learning to predict the base/accurate price trend for properties in big cities for homeowner or renters.
